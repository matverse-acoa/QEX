# MatVerse/QEX Architecture Overview

## Purpose
QEX (QuantumSphere SIC³Q) defines a **hybrid security and governance architecture** that unifies:

- **Classical systems** (deterministic pipelines, cryptographic hashing, append-only ledgers).
- **Quantum-resilient systems** (post-quantum cryptography, coherent risk metrics, quantum-informed observability).
- **Algebraic systems** (formal operators, compositional failure algebra, invariant-preserving decision kernels).

This hybrid structure treats **security and governance as intrinsic system laws**, not optional layers.

## Architectural Layers

1. **Evidence Layer (Classical)**
   - Append-only logs for every critical action.
   - Hash chaining and Merkle roots for tamper evidence.
   - Deterministic verification for replay and forensic audit.

2. **Decision Layer (Governance Kernel)**
   - A normative gate that enforces decision admissibility.
   - Fail-closed default behavior when metrics or proofs are missing.
   - Action outcomes constrained to allow/block/silence/escalate.

3. **Risk & Coherence Layer (Metrics)**
   - Multi-objective scoring combines coherence, latency, tail risk, and operational cost.
   - Policy-driven thresholds define admissible state transitions.

4. **Post-Quantum Trust Layer (PQC)**
   - KEMs and signatures resistant to quantum attacks.
   - Receipts and governance proofs can be signed with PQC keys.
   - Supports long-term evidence retention against future adversaries.

5. **FailQuantum Algebra Layer**
   - Compositional algebra models failure aggregation.
   - Thermodynamic cost functions quantify irreversible transitions.
   - Prevents entropic escalation and enforces energy-aware decisioning.

## Core Properties

- **Fail-closed governance**: if proofs or metrics are incomplete, execution halts.
- **Evidence-first operations**: every decision produces audit-ready artifacts.
- **Hybrid resilience**: classical determinism + post-quantum protection + algebraic invariants.
- **Temporal security**: past (forensics), present (active gating), future (threat anticipation).

## Traceability
Every critical action produces a signed receipt that can be independently verified. This establishes:

- Non-repudiation for governance decisions.
- Publicly auditable policy enforcement.
- Long-term integrity guarantees, even under future quantum threat models.

# QEX

QuantumSphere (SIC³Q) is the MatVerse security and governance core. It formalizes a **hybrid quantum-classical-algebraic architecture** designed for antifragile decisioning, evidence-first operations, and post-quantum resilience.

## What this repository provides

- **Hybrid architecture**: classical determinism + post-quantum trust + algebraic governance.
- **Fail-closed decision kernel**: every action is mediated by a normative gate.
- **Evidence-first operations**: append-only receipts with hash-linked audit trails.
- **Thermodynamic cost awareness**: FailQuantum integrates energy/entropy cost into decisions.
- **Temporal security model**: past/present/future security validation.
